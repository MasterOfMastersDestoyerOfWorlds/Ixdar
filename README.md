Meeting notes 1/1/21

Need a log of everything we are trying and should branch when we try new shit also need to put all references we used in either this file or a bibliography

Need to do some theory crafting for the line case

Potentials are transforming circle to line and n-d transformation of line to a circle at infinity

Ares’ thoughts about the future: how long do we want to work on this if we can’t find the optimal solution

Andrew till I can’t think of things to try. Will prolly work last two weeks of break and over the semester/summer

Ryan till he starts working after the summer, will also be working in January.

Ares looking for a job also will be working during semester.

meet in the middle of January and end of January

Meeting notes 1/21/21

Ares should try and look into why 15-17 fail but djbouti succ, 

also is the ring we make in PointSet.toShells is a tsp path if not why

Need to fix infinite loop in collapse reduce why? why?

- need to add is point dummy to PointND
