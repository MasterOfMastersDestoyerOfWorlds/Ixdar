example: mtf - this command will calculate all shortest cutmatch paths (see readme: hole moving game) on all pairs of cut segments
in the top knot of the current ixdar file. So if our current knot is a circle formed by 5 segments, then the resulting manifold master file would 
contain 4*(5^2) cutmatch paths; accounting for all orientations of the starting cut segments.

if the current file is named ixdar.ix in the /solutions/ixdar/ folder the resulting manifold test file would be in /solutions/ixdar-manifold/ with 
the name ixdar-manifold_master.ix
